<h4>Bullet points are used to draw attention to important information within a document so that a reader can identify the key issues and facts quickly. There are no fixed rules about how to use them, but here are some guidelines:

1.The text introducing the list of bullet points should end with a colon.

2. If the text that follows the bullet point is not a proper sentence, it doesn’t need to begin with a capital letter, nor end with a period. For example:

Tonight's agenda includes:

      annual review of capital gains issues
      outstanding inheritance tax issues
3. If the text following the bullet point is a complete sentence, it should begin with a capital letter, while a period at the end is technically required but is not absolutely essential:
