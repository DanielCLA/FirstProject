<h1> Is the Moon made of cheese?</h1>


<h3> The Moon is made of something</h3>


<p>
It is not commonly known that many of the Bibleâ€™s statements about astronomy went against the generally accepted teachings of the time. Modern science, however, has confirmed what the Bible has taught. As in all things, the Bible is absolutely correct when it teaches about the universe.

<p>Recent scientific studies have shown that the moon is not made of cheese. This is because the moon is made of a entirely different matter; cheese has entirely different atoms therefore the moon is not made of cheese.</p>
